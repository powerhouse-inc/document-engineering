# Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts apply to `ObjectSetTable` when a cell is selected (visible focus ring). While editing a cell, most keys go to the input itself; use Enter/Escape to finish.

## Navigation (not editing)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Arrow Right/Left/Down/Up | Move the selected cell in the given direction |
| Tab | Move to the next cell to the right; wraps to the first column of the next row |
| Enter | Enter edit mode if the selected cell is editable |

For selection behavior and row-level options, see [Rows → Row Selection](?path=/docs/data-display-object-set-table-docs-rows--readme#row-selection).

## Editing mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Enter | Save the current cell and move selection to the next row (same column) |
| Escape | Cancel changes and exit edit mode (selection stays on the same cell) |

How editing, validation, and saving work is covered in [Editing](?path=/docs/data-display-object-set-table-docs-editing--readme).

## Row selection (with mouse modifiers)

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Click cell | Select cell |
| Double‑click editable cell | Enter edit mode |
| Click row number | Select that row |
| Ctrl/Cmd + Click row/number | Toggle row selection |
| Shift + Click row/number | Select a range of rows from last active row |
| Click header # cell | Toggle select‑all when selection is enabled |

Details about selection, row numbers, and minimum row count are in [Rows](?path=/docs/data-display-object-set-table-docs-rows--readme).

## Deletion

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Delete | Delete selected rows (when deletion is enabled). A confirmation dialog is shown. |

Deletion requires the `onDelete` prop and never deletes placeholder rows added by `minRowCount`. See [Deletion](?path=/docs/data-display-object-set-table-docs-deletion--readme) and [Rows → Row Height and Count](?path=/docs/data-display-object-set-table-docs-rows--readme#row-height-and-count).

## Adding

When `onAdd` is provided, an insertion row appears at the bottom. The same editing shortcuts (Enter to save, Escape to cancel) apply there. See [Adding](?path=/docs/data-display-object-set-table-docs-adding--readme).

## Notes

- Shortcuts are active when a cell is selected (focus is inside the table).
- While editing a cell, arrow keys navigate within the editor input; use Enter/Escape to finish.
- Shift+Tab navigation is not currently supported; use Arrow Left to move left.
